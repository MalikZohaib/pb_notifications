What does it do?
----------------

This extension manages notifications for editors in the backend.

  * You can create two types of notifications (information / warning).
  * Select the backend user groups, which should see this notification (leave empty for all users)
  * Add up to 3 images to your notification to illustrate the information

The editors get a list of notifications in the TYPO3 backend.
If there are new, unread notifications, they will see a coloured icon according to that in the top-bar inside the TYPO3 backend.
